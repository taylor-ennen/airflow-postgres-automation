# Advanced Airflow Docker Setup Script

## Overview
This script automates the setup of Apache Airflow in a Docker environment, using PostgreSQL as the backend. It encapsulates best practices from the Airflow, Docker, and Linux communities, ensuring a secure, efficient, and user-friendly installation.

## Features
- **Automated Setup**: Creates Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and user management script.
- **Secure**: Handles sensitive information like passwords carefully.
- **Customizable**: Allows for easy customization and configuration.
- **Dependency Checks**: Ensures Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Usage
Run the script, navigate to the created directory (`airflow-docker-setup`), and execute `docker-compose up` to start the Airflow instance.

## Best Practices Implemented
- **Parameterization**: The script allows for flexible configuration.
- **Security**: Sensitive data is not hardcoded but can be set via environment variables.
- **Documentation**: This README provides clear instructions for setup and usage.

## Why This Project?
This project simplifies the process of setting up a robust Airflow environment, making it accessible to those with basic Docker knowledge while ensuring advanced users can still customize as needed. All that said, I also figured while I'm learning this I could practice in some other areas like Linux Shell Scripting where I've not had as much experience. This may not solve a problem for many, but was worth the time and experience and may be useful for someone else to learn from.

## Abstracted Complexity
To prevent misuse by inexperienced users, the script requires basic familiarity with Docker (which is not included with this project purposefully), and does not expose sensitive configuration details in plaintext or within the script itself.
